Smart Demand Forecast is a Flask-based web application designed for demand forecasting and inventory management. It allows users to upload their own datasets, generate demand forecasts, view dashboards, and download detailed reports in PDF and CSV formats.

## Features

- Upload CSV datasets with product demand and inventory data.
- Validate and preprocess uploaded datasets.
- Generate demand forecasts for selected products over customizable time horizons.
- View interactive dashboards showing forecasted demand for all products.
- Download forecast results as CSV files.
- Generate comprehensive PDF reports with visualizations and key inventory metrics.
- Uses SARIMAX-based forecasting logic (in `forecast.py`).
- Caching mechanism for uploaded datasets to improve performance.
